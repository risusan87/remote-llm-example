# As of late 2025, GPU is the only reliable and widely adopted way to powerfully compute massive weights network to power AIs, particularlly, Generative AI such as Chat GPT. The concern is, GPUs are expensive, of course for individuals, but even for small-mid scale companies those demand AI powered services.

# The solutions is to use cloud GPU services, or API inference services such as Lambda AI, and Open AI API.
# This repository exactly demonstrate (hopefully) how to bring these into your application.
